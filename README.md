# BITS-ACM-R2-Progress

I went for the AI/ML vertical because I had "some" prior experience in it. CBSE Board taught me basic Data analysis and then I immediately dove down into the world of Machine Learning

ML truly amazes me every single time I read about or program some Neural Network. Making an intelligent network (All out of JUST MATH) from scratch fascinates me everytime.

Full disclosure, I unfortunately could not give this as much time as I wanted to because of multiple simultaneous Club Recruitments and Quizzes going on.
This is why this Repo contains both Old and Recent Projects of mine related to AI/ML

So for my task I tried learning more about **Tensorflow, PyTorch and the Theory behind it all** to build up on my existing knowledge of Machine Learning.

Earlier I had learnt about the Theory from [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)
and simultaneously went through some of the Tensorflow tutorials on Youtube 

(Some I remember vaguely are [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ8BIBpya2k), [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVQUSndDllU) and some tutorials on [Tensorflow official channel](https://www.youtube.com/@tensorflow))

I **TRIED** doing some Kaggle competitions aswell but again couldn't do much because, JEE Times.



**Present day**, In the past few days, I have gone through:
+ some more Youtube Tutorials ([StatQuest with Josh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUIxGDQs4LFFD--41Vzf-ME1))
+ PyTorch Documentation - [Learn the basics](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/#learn-the-basics)
+ CS229 - Went through the Linear Algebra and Probability sheets, Learnt some of the theory about Linear Regression
+ Some other blogposts and touched some of the tutorials recommended on the ML-Resources page.

Again, I definitely want to learn more about these things and build cool projects using this Technology, But this is mostly the extent of my knowledge currently.
